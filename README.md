# 6502-to-W65C02S-adapter
A small daughterboard adapter that replaces a 6502 processor (used in vintage 8-bit computers such as the VIC-20 and BBC Micro) with a modern, currently manufactured CMOS equivalent. Two versions of the daughterboard are provided (long and short), which fit different motherboards. At the time of this upload, the adapter had been successfully tested in Commodore VIC-20 computers, in both versions of the VIC-20's motherboard. But it failed testing in an Apple //e, most likely due to the extra latency added to the data bus signals by the transceiver. If you are an Apple //e user, there is an alternative that requires no custom PCB (for instructions, see <a href ="https://youtu.be/BtxW8AWfh9s">this video</a>).
