# 6502-to-W65C02S-adapter
A small daughterboard adapter that replaces a 6502 processor (used in vintage 8-bit computers such as the VIC-20, Apple II and BBC Micro) with a modern, currently manufactured CMOS equivalent. Two versions of the daughterboard are provided (long and short), which fit different motherboards. At the time of this upload, the adapter had been tested only in Commodore VIC-20 computers, in both versions of the VIC-20's motherboard. In both cases it worked flawlessly.
