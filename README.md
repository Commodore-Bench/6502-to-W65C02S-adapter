# 6502-to-W65C02S-adapter
A small daughterboard adapter that replaces a 6502 processor (used in vintage 8-bit computers such as the VIC-20, Apple ][ and BBC Micro) with a modern equivalent. Two versions are provided, which fit different motherboards. At the time of uploading this had been tested only in Commodore VIC-20 computers, both short and long boards. In both cases it worked flawlessly.
